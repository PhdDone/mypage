Hi, I'm Yuanzhe Dong.
<p>I'm interested in Machine Learning and how to apply it to solve NLP problems, currently I'm working on Machine Translation. Here's my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuanzhe-dong-97989546">Linkedin</a></p>
<p>I'm also interested in Front-End web developing since the most frequent question I need to answer to my friends is "Can you make a website/ an App?". Now in my spare time I help them improve their website. Here's my <a href="https://github.com/PhdDone">GitHub</a>. Feel free to send me an <a href="mailto:onemoretolearn@gmail.com">email</a></p>
<p>Most of the time I write C++, recently I begin to write Go</p>
